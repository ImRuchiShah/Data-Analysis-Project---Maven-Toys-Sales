# Data-Analysis-Project - Maven-Toys-Sales

**About this project**

This project was part of the Maven Challenge series. The dataset is a sample of sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

**Key Questions:**

- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

**Key Insights:**

- Toys is, on average, the most profitable category.
- Airport locations are more profitable and should be a focus for expansion.
- Even though Electronics has the most profitable product, the category as a whole is trending downward.
- Art & Crafts is an up and coming profitable category and is trending up over the last year.
