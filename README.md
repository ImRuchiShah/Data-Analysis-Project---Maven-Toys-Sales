# Data-Analysis-Project - Mexico-Toys-Sales

**About this project**

The dataset is a sample of sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

**About the dataset**:

This dataset contains 4 tables, in CSV format:

- The Products table contains the 35 products sold at Maven Toys (each record represents one product), with fields containing details about the product category, cost, and retail price
- The Stores table contains the 50 Maven Toys store locations (each record represents one store), with fields containing details about the store location, type, and date it opened
- The Sales table contains the units sold in over 800,000 sales transactions from January 2017 to October 2018 (each record represents the purchase of a specific product at a specific store on a specific date)
- The Inventory table contains over 1,500 records that represent the stock on hand of each product in each store at the current point in time (Oct 1, 2018)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI

**Steps Performed:**
- Connecting and Shaping the source date
- Building a relational model
- Adding calculated columns and measures
- Designing an interactive report


**Key Questions:**

- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

**Key Insights:**

- Toys is, on average, the most profitable category.
- Airport locations are more profitable and should be a focus for expansion.
- Even though Electronics has the most profitable product, the category as a whole is trending downward.
- Art & Crafts is an up and coming profitable category and is trending up over the last year.
